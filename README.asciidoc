== tfclient

tfclient is a library to communicate with ThreadFix's REST API from the Go language.  It has implemented calls to every exposed API method as documented in the https://github.com/denimgroup/threadfix/wiki/Threadfix-REST-Interface[ThreadFix REST Interface] wiki page.  Using the library you can either get the raw JSON returned by the API or populate Structs which normalize the data returned from ThreadFix into more Go-like data structures.

This code has been written and tested against the libray presented by the ThreadFix 2.1.2 Official release.

I am waiting for the release of the 2.2 version of ThreadFix before I make this "go get"-able.  Those changes will be commited shortly after 2.2 is release and I make sure the API hasn't changed on me.
