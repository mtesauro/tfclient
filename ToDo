* Consider creating individual functions to pull out each piece of the returned and unmarshalled JSON so that code can be reused
** Like the same JSON that is returned before the "object" bit
** Could error out early if the "success" provided isn't true
* Write a nil check functiont that takes a pointer to something and its type as a string and sets the value to an empty version if its nil
** Use it for all the optional values returned from TF's API
